I want to get out of this job and this company and want to get a 1 lac per month software engineering job 
i have to work hard and smart to get this kind of package 
i have to learn to explain what i know and also i have to learn to explain what i dont know 
i have to create a 3 minute video of mine of explaining a topic to an interviewer, by this i'll be able to 
know where i am lacking
first of all i have to be damn good at DSA 
i have to be able to solve almost every problem that is given to me in case of a very hard problem i still have to
come up with a brut-force solution and for the familier problem i have to comeup with 3-4 kind of solution brute, better,
even better and optimal.
i also have to regularly learn core subjects like OS, OOPs, DBMS, SQL, CN, Javascript, any web development framework like 
next or react, backend framework like express.
i also have to build very big and operations heavy project to show case my software engineering skills, projects 
like an ecommerce website with all the features that are available in market.
parallaly with that i have to keep searching for reference from big MNCs, i have to call out for all the students of DAIICT, 
my friends who are working in big MNCs, my linkedin connections, even my friend's relatives the one who is in salesforce.
getting a single call of interview will be a great blessing for me straight from the god and i have to take advantage of 
it by any fucking cost 
I have to be unstoppable to work in big MNC i have to work hard and hard and hard and smart also, being an avrage guy in 
studies i know where i stand 
so with that in mind i have to study very hard more than my peers
i have to study smartly so i can ensure that i am not wasting my precious time on unnecessary things 
i have to create a time table where i will define my weekly goals and monthly goals 
by creating a time table i can be accountable of my time 
as i know i have to do 4 months of internship even if they not give me stipend 
so with that in mind now i have only 3 months left 
so in 3 months i have to be interview ready.
24/2/25
making whole lot of efforts for getting a good job doesn't seem very fruitful to me nowadays 
i am thinking about what if i make these efforts to build my own environment
this is 100 times more difficult than what i am doing right now and i know that very well.
even i dont know that i can achieve even a single thing that i am aiming or thinking to achieve right now 
so what can be the right thought to have in mind 
i have student loan to pay and i can't rely on my parents for this 
although they are ok with whatever i want to do but i know they are not in condition to make me do hustle for 
3-4 years more with financial support
also there is one more problem as the business i am thinking about is 50% on desgin part (renting wedding wears 
mostly for women ) 
and i have to rely on my sister because she knows the craft very well and doing this without her doesn't make 
any sense overall but but but she is getting married and i dont know how things will going to work after her 
marriage 
as i think that i am the only one who is very serious about the startup i have to take well researched and 
well thought decision 
i have to pay loan by myself and also take responcibilty of my family.
so i am thinking that I will first become master of my craft and based on that will get a very high paying job
this can take 1-2 years and by this much time i will get clarity about how to start a startup as well as how i 
have to structure the working of the startup like who is going to take care of what part of the business 
also by this much time and effort i will have enough knowledge and money to start and run a sustainable 
and profitable buiness 

untill than i will create a basic structure of the business model and all the necessary resources that i will need 
when i am about to take the bet.
