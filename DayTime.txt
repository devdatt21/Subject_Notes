I want to get out of this job and this company and want to get a 1 lac per month software engineering job 
i have to work hard and smart to get this kind of package 
i have to learn to explain what i know and also i have to learn to explain what i dont know 
i have to create a 3 minute video of mine of explaining a topic to an interviewer, by this i'll be able to 
know where i am lacking
first of all i have to be damn good at DSA 
i have to be able to solve almost every problem that is given to me in case of a very hard problem i still have to
come up with a brut-force solution and for the familier problem i have to comeup with 3-4 kind of solution brute, better,
even better and optimal.
i also have to regularly learn core subjects like OS, OOPs, DBMS, SQL, CN, Javascript, any web development framework like 
next or react, backend framework like express.
i also have to build very big and operations heavy project to show case my software engineering skills, projects 
like an ecommerce website with all the features that are available in market.
parallaly with that i have to keep searching for reference from big MNCs, i have to call out for all the students of DAIICT, 
my friends who are working in big MNCs, my linkedin connections, even my friend's relatives the one who is in salesforce.
getting a single call of interview will be a great blessing for me straight from the god and i have to take advantage of 
it by any fucking cost 
I have to be unstoppable to work in big MNC i have to work hard and hard and hard and smart also, being an avrage guy in 
studies i know where i stand 
so with that in mind i have to study very hard more than my peers
i have to study smartly so i can ensure that i am not wasting my precious time on unnecessary things 
i have to create a time table where i will define my weekly goals and monthly goals 
by creating a time table i can be accountable of my time 
as i know i have to do 4 months of internship even if they not give me stipend 
so with that in mind now i have only 3 months left 
so in 3 months i have to be interview ready.
