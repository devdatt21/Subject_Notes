next js uses file based routing 
    so you dont have to configure the routing manually
    next js will do it for you 


next js uses conventions instead of configurations


Anchor tag in nextJS redownloads all the required files 
    from the server, but 

Link tag only redownload the needed file when we click on 
    the link button
